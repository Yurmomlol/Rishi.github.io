# Rishi.github.io
My name is Rishi Sakthikumaran and my email is rjsk688@gmail.com
My GitHub account only contains one repository and I can access this account either on the web or as a computer application.
The repository I created will be used to add files to it in future assignments.
In order to clone the repository to my machine I first downloaded the GitHub application from the google chrome web browser then created a repository after signing into my account by selecting "Clone repository." Afterwards I then selected the location within where that repository should get cloned as the documents section within my folders.
